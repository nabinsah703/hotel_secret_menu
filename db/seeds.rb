# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
menu1 = SecretMenuItem.create(menu_name: "Chipotle Nachos", restaurant_name: "KFC", menu_description: "build a plaate of nachos with all of your favorite fixing ")
menu2 = SecretMenuItem.create(menu_name: "Starbucks butterbeer Frappuccino", restaurant_name: "Starbucks", menu_description:"Combine three pumps of toffee nut syrup and three pumps of caramel with a Cr√®me Frappuccino base")
